- Solve problems using methods

### 📚 Methods Overview
A method is a block of code that performs a specific task.  
Methods help in organizing code, improving readability, and promoting reusability.

### 🔹 Types of Methods
- **Void Methods**: Perform an action but do not return a value  
- **Return Type Methods**: Perform an action and return a value  
- **Methods with Parameters**: Accept input values to process data  
- **Methods without Parameters**: Execute tasks without external input

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Methods reduce code duplication
- Parameters make methods flexible
- Return values help in processing results
- Methods improve code structure and maintainability
